    "# Chart Benchmark Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this comparison is to measure each chart libraries performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "We use dataset from [data.json](./bench/data.json) which has `388,858` data points. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Disclaimer\n",
    "\n",
    "- I mostly did not edit code. All I changed files in bench folder is to format code and replace `fetch(./data.json)` with `fetch(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leeoniya/uPlot/master/bench/data.json\")` since data wasn't loaded on browser.\n",
    "  - Also, added zoom feature in [Echart5.html](./bench/ECharts5.html) to compare the performance between Echarts and uPlot.\n",
    "- I removed some chart libraries' files since these libraries don't meet our requirements, or library versions are outdated.\n",
    "- Even though I didn't change logic in files, some chart styles look broken. However, I believe it's not an issue to measure benchmarks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Credit\n",

    "## How to Measure Benchmarks\n",
    "\n",
    "In the [bench folder](./bench/) files, you can find code like `console.time('prep');`, `console.timeEnd('prep');`, so you can see how long it took to render charts. In these files, we measure 2 things. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. `prep` time: how long it takes to prepare data for charts\n",
    "2. `chart` time: how long it takes to render charts\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see the respective result in browser console.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way of measurement is to refresh each chart pages 3 times and get the average.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Env\n",
    "\n",
    "- Chrome with private mode\n",
    "- M1 Mac with Apple M1 Max (10 core), 32 GB mem"
